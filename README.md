In order to make the architecture cleaner, in the beginning I considered combining network code from :app module and :storage module to obtain data layer.
Therefore, I wanted to make Repository with two DataSources within :data module. However, going through the requirement list, especially task number 3, I decided to elevate network code to a separate (:network) module. For such a small application I thought having 4 modules is enough.
I didn't want to remove :domain module. Instead I decided to remove all redundant dependencies between local modules and transformed domain into a "contract" module. To achieve this, I created two DataSource interfaces: TodoNetworkDataSource and TodoStorageDataSource. Each of them is an entry point to the particular module. Besides that I created Repository which combines usage of DataSources. I also introduced UseCases. Even though they do net contain any specific logic themselves, they help to make the architecture cleaner.

First step after establishing architecture was to download and present list of todos. After that I started storing downloaded tasks in the database. Next, I implemented sorting mechanism. At last, I managed to present todo details and provided with an option to edit them.
